# Redshift Data Sharing Demo

This repository has example SQL code to

1. Create a table + add a few rows of data to it 
2. Create a data share
3. Share the data share with a consumer (ie. different) Redshift instance
4. Consumer the data share from the producer Redshift instance

## Future Improvements for this Repository

1. Add an architecture diagram to the README
2. Add a CloudFormation template to deploy two Redshift cluster
